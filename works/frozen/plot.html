        <p id="line">This November, Frozen is returning to the Greenwich Picturehouse in a special Sing-a-long event.<br> For one week only!!!</p>
<p id="synopsis">A sweet, magical film filled with great music, quirky, lovable characters, and striking effects, Frozen is a fairy tale about overcoming obstacles and the power of true love. Princesses Anna and Elsa are sisters and the closest friends until one day Elsa discovers that she can no longer control her ice powers. Terrified for the safety of her sister and everyone around her, Elsa isolates herself and vows to never feel any sort of passionate emotion again in hopes of suppressing her powers. But when Elsa comes of age and is set to be crowned queen, she must open the gates of the palace and let in the public, and Anna. Things go horribly wrong and Anna pursues her sister into the mountains in an attempt to save Elsa and reverse the eternal winter that Elsa has inadvertently released on the kingdom of Arendelle. Along the way, Anna joins forces with Kristoff, an ice seller with a peculiar relationship with his reindeer Sven, and Olaf, a goofy snowman whom Elsa has built in exile. Inspired by &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; story by Hans Christian Andersen, including original songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, and an original score by Christophe Beck, Frozen definitely succeeds in captivating audiences young, old, and every age in between.</p>
